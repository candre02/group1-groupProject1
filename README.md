Group 1, Project 1-- Weather GiFinder

## Purpose
Our purpose was to create a website that was equal parts practical and playful—allowing users to gather weather related data through a search by city function, while also providing a series of gifs related to the city and/or weather report. 

## Process
In order to complete this project in the most efficient manner we first reviewed the various strengths and weaknesses of the team members, in order to determine who was the best fit for each aspect of the project.
The greatest challenge that we faced was managing time around each team member’s individual schedule. With differing work schedules and childcare responsibilities, the times when all team members were simultaneously available were limited.
Our strong communication and commitment to working together collaboratively enabled us to successfully manage our time-related challenges and complete this project on schedule.

## Future
Iterations of this project could enhance the user experience by providing more detailed weather data, such as radar images, as well as city-specific information on upcoming events.
